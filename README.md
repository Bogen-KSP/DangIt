# DANG IT!
*A Random Failures Mod for Kerbal Space Program*

Nicely cobbled together by Ippo (m.ippolito@outlook.com)
and rescued from oblivion by 602p: contact me on the KSP forums at Coffeeman or at <louis@goessling.com>

Please note that this mod is still (deep) in *Alpha*. Bugs might happen (even nasty ones), and future updates might be incompatible with previous versions, at any time.
**Use only if you are ok with testing unfinished mods!**

This mod requires the latest version of Module Manager to function: you can get it [here](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55219-Module-Manager-1-5-6-%28Jan-6%29). 
This mod bundles KSPAPIExtentions.dll inside of it's mod folder.
