*A Random Failures Mod for Kerbal Space Program*

Nicely cobbled together by Ippo (m.ippolito@outlook.com)

Latest incarnation is by Linuxgurugamer, with the Entropy add-on written by 602p merged into the mod


This mod requires the latest version of Module Manager to function, included in the zip file
